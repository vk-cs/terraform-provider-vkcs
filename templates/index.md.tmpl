# VKCS Provider

The VKCS provider is used to interact with [VKCS services](https://mcs.mail.ru/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 1.1.5 and later:

```terraform
# Configure the vkcs provider

terraform {
  required_providers {
    vkcs = {
      source = "vk-cs/vkcs"
      version = "< 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Create new compute instance
resource "vkcs_compute_instance" "myinstance"{
  # ...
}
```

## Authentication

The VKCS provider supports username/password authentication. Preconfigured provider file with `username` and `project_id` can be downloaded from [https://mcs.mail.ru/app/project](https://mcs.mail.ru/app/project) portal. Go to `Terraform` tab -> click on the "Download VKCS provider file".

```terraform
provider "vkcs" {
    username   = "USERNAME"
    password   = "PASSWORD"
    project_id = "PROJECT_ID"
}
```

## Working with VKCS Cloud Storage

VKCS provider does not support working with cloud storage.
To do this, we recommend an AWS provider, you can learn how to use it by following this [documentation](https://cloud.vk.com/docs/en/tools-for-using-services/terraform/how-to-guides/aws).
