  Attaches a Block Storage Volume to an Instance.

{{ .Description }}

## Example Usage
### Basic attachment of a single volume to a single instance
{{tffile "templates/compute/resources/vkcs_compute_volume_attach/basic-single-single/main.tf"}}

### Attaching multiple volumes to a single instance
{{tffile "templates/compute/resources/vkcs_compute_volume_attach/multi-single/main.tf"}}

Note that the above example will not guarantee that the volumes are attached in
a deterministic manner. The volumes will be attached in a seemingly random
order.

If you want to ensure that the volumes are attached in a given order, create
explicit dependencies between the volumes, such as:

{{tffile "templates/compute/resources/vkcs_compute_volume_attach/multi-single-ordered/main.tf"}}
{{ .SchemaMarkdown }}

## Import

Volume Attachments can be imported using the Instance ID and Volume ID separated by a slash, e.g.

{{codefile "shell" "templates/compute/resources/vkcs_compute_volume_attach/import.sh"}}
