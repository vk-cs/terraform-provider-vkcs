{{ .Description }}

## Examples
### Usage with one volume
{{tffile .ExampleFile}}

### Usage with ORDERED multiple volumes
Attaching multiple volumes will not guarantee that the volumes are attached in
a deterministic manner. The volumes will be attached in a seemingly random
order.

If you want to ensure that the volumes are attached in a given order, create
explicit dependencies between the volumes, such as:
{{tffile "examples/compute/volume_attach/multi-ordered/main.tf"}}
{{ .SchemaMarkdown }}

## Import

Volume Attachments can be imported using the Instance ID and Volume ID separated by a slash, e.g.

{{codefile "shell" "templates/compute/resources/vkcs_compute_volume_attach/import.sh"}}
