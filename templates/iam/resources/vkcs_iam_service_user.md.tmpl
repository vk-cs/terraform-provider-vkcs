{{ .Description }}

!> **Security Note:** `password` is marked as sensitive, and, therefore, will not be shown in outputs by default, but you should consider protecting it as input variable and state value. To get more information on the topic, you can refer to the [official tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables).

To get information on available roles for service accounts, refer to to the VK Cloud [documentation](https://cloud.vk.com/docs/en/tools-for-using-services/account/concepts/rolesandpermissions).
