# vkcs\_compute\_servergroup

Manages a Server Group resource within OpenStack.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vkcs_compute_servergroup" "test-sg" {
  name     = "my-sg"
  policies = ["anti-affinity"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client.
    If omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing
    this creates a new server group.

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the server group. Changing this creates
    a new server group.

* `policies` - (Required) The set of policies for the server group. All policies
    are mutually exclusive. See the Policies section for more information.
    Changing this creates a new server group.

* `value_specs` - (Optional) Map of additional options.

## Policies

* `affinity` - All instances/servers launched in this group will be hosted on
    the same compute node.

* `anti-affinity` - All instances/servers launched in this group will be
    hosted on different compute nodes.

* `soft-affinity` - All instances/servers launched in this group will be hosted
    on the same compute node if possible, but if not possible they
    still will be scheduled instead of failure. To use this policy your
    OpenStack environment should support Compute service API 2.15 or above.

* `soft-anti-affinity` - All instances/servers launched in this group will be
    hosted on different compute nodes if possible, but if not possible they
    still will be scheduled instead of failure. To use this policy your
    OpenStack environment should support Compute service API 2.15 or above.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `region` - See Argument Reference above.
* `name` - See Argument Reference above.
* `policies` - See Argument Reference above.
* `members` - The instances that are part of this server group.

## Import

Server Groups can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vkcs_compute_servergroup.test-sg 1bc30ee9-9d5b-4c30-bdd5-7f1e663f5edf
```
